# WEALTHFRONT IN LIMBO

## Overview and Origin

Wealthfront Inc. is an automated investment service firm based in Palo Alto, California, founded by Benchmark co-founder Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll in 2008. As of September 2019, Wealthfront had $21 billion AUM across 400,000 accounts. [1] The company started life as kaChing, a mutual fund analysis company, before pivoting into wealth management. Rachleff was the firm's founding CEO. In December 2012, the firm started tax-loss harvesting for accounts of more than $100,000. Now it is a full-fledged Robo-advisor.

The idea behind Wealthfront can be explained best by co-founder, Rachleff. "At a high level, kaChing, as Wealthfround was known. is looking to bring some transparency to the mutual fund industry.” CEO Andy Rachleff explains that it’s nearly impossible to do much analysis on how a mutual fund is performing — they only disclose the positions they hold at the very end of the quarter. “You don’t know what kind of trades they executed during the quarter, and they can sell off their bad holdings just before the end of the quarter so that you’d never know they had them. kaChing turns this model on its head.”

It invites top traders to publicly share their trades, revealing information that until now was only disclosed to Ivy League institutions. Rachleff says the top traders benefit because they can accept many amateur investors as clients with very little extra work. And everyone else benefits because they gain access to this data.

Here’s how it works: kaChing has gathered a dozen top investors, many of them professionals, which it has certified to be “Geniuses.” Anyone who comes to the site is free to look at the entire trading history of these Geniuses, free of charge. If you like what you see, you can sign up for kaChing and create a brokerage account through its partner, Interactive Brokers (a well-established and publically traded brokerage firm). Deposit some money (the minimum is $3,000), and you’re set. From then on, the site will automatically execute trades for you to exactly mirror the Genius you’ve signed up to follow. [2]

The company started with Angel investors in a seed round on December 16, 2008. The money raised was $3 mm. The angel investors included Michael Jones; Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape and initial creator of Javascript; Kevin Compton, Jeff Jordan, Doug Mackenzie, Bruce Dunlevie, and Andy Rachleff. Soon after, in December 2009, they closed another funding Series A round of $7.5 mm. Another $20 mm was raised in a Series B funding in March 2013. In April 2014, a Series C funding of $35 mm was raised during a late-stage venture. In October of the same year, a Series D of $64 mm was raised by Wealthfront. In January 2018, $75 mm was submitted by a lead investor of Tiger Global. And finally, most recently, UBS and Wealthfront had announced a merger only to turn around and say they were both walking away from the deal. Instead, UBS received a convertible note of $69.7 mm, valuing Wealthfront at $1.3 Bln. All total, Wealthfront has raised $274.2 mm in seven funding rounds.[3]

## Business Activities

Robo advising tries to conduct an automated investing service that invests in low-cost funds like index funds or proprietary funds that eliminate exorbitant fees charged by money advisors. Research has shown that mutual funds often perform no better than the S&P 500. Add in the two to three-percent fees some funds are charging, and small investors lose out in the long run. Wealthfront nearly eliminates high costs with low 0.25% rates for their services.

The problem with Wealthfront’s current offerings is that it isn’t much different from some of the other Robo-Advisers. It’s hard to differentiate its service, so Wealthfront has tried to offer checking and savings account services that are also FDIC-insured.

All Robo-advisers provide digital financial advice based on mathematical rules or algorithms. These algorithms are designed by financial advisors, investment managers, and data scientists and coded in software by programmers. These algorithms are executed by software and do not require a human advisor to impart financial advice to a client. The software utilizes its algorithms to automatically allocate, manage and optimize clients' assets for either short-run or long-run investment. Robo-advisors are categorized based on the extent of personalization, discretion, involvement, and human interaction. Wealthfront has little to no human interaction. [4] This lack of human interaction could be why the company needs help building clientele.

## Landscape

Lately, Wealthfront has been talking about offering more trading capabilities besides banking services, and personalization, like Robinhood. Though Wealthfront has been around longer, at a little over a billion dollars, its valuation is only 3% of what Robinhood was valued at for its IPO. This trading sentiment change is against what it has always preached in that the individual is the worst investor and stock picker. The company expounded that we should leave investing to software to trade on the Efficient market hypothesis. But humans clearly love to gamble. There is no excitement with steady as she goes. As far as I know, they are no chat rooms dedicated to Wealthfront like Game Stop traders.

Vanguard, Betterment, LearnVest, and Schwab are Wealthfront’s biggest competitors. In total, there are over a hundred different companies in this space. Vanguard has come to dominate Robo-advising since it was the king of Exchange Traded Funds and low-cost investing.

## Results

Robo-advising shook up the investment management space. It's caused big firms such as Schwab, UBS, and Vanguard to pay attention and have their own Robo offerings.

Assets under management (AUM) is the core metric for success. Wealthfront currently has $22 bln. [5] Which, according to Forbes, makes it the 4th largest Robo-Advisor. [6] Number 1 is Vanguard Robo-Advisors.

Wealthfront has pivoted its business model around six times, according to RIABiz. [7] They also needed help with product offerings to differentiate themselves from other advisors.

## Recommendations

As for recommendations, this is very hard to make. In the near term, five to ten years, an algorithmic trading platform like Robo-advisors is excellent for the small investor as it can manage a reliable, low-cost investing option for anyone. However, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and especially personal AI, can really individualize investing for everyone without the need for outside advisors. I recommend consolidation in the space—a combination of Wealthfront and Betterment, its closest rival.

After consolidation, the firms can offer even more fintech-related services like mortgages, insurance, etc. They can finally be a one-stop shop for all things fintech. Otherwise, Wealthfornt will continue to be in limbo as it struggles to find its footing for the future.
